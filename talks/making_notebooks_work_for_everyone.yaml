    Rather than focus on a single notebook I will cover some of the highlights of the Azure Sentinel Notebooks we have published from the perspective of making them usable and resilient for a wide range of users and skill sets.
    This will focus less on the specific technology and features (although we will look at some) but instead look at how we have taken Notebooks from something you personally develop and use at a individual or team level and developed generic versions that can in theory be used by any Sentinel customer regardless of skill, and largely agnostic of what data you have.
    All the Notebooks we have are open sourced and I will pick elements from across them to demo and talk about.
