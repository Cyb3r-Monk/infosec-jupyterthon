    A basic ability is mapping a bunch of network logs - Zeek, CloudTrails, FireEye/Palo Alto firewall, VPN, etc. - and especially together. Visual graph analysis of log files and SIEM queries is a natural fit.
    The trick is handling log volume and avoiding UI coding.
    This surprisingly tiny notebook shares going from a large log file, through the emerging pip-installable open source GPU python analytics ecosystem RAPIDS.ai (think Pandas, SQL, SciKit, Spark, NetworkX, ...), and into point-and-click GPU visual graph analysis tool Graphistry.
    The result is, with a few lines of code, you can quickly go from a log query to graph insights, even when there are billions of nodes and edges!
