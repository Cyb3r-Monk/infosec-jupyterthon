    A Security Operations Center can be a hard thing to explain - often involving complex technical activities like managing detection rules and threat hunting.
    At Expel, we want our service to be as transparent as possible.
    For the past 2 1/2 years we've been using Jupyter notebooks to help make these kinds of difficult tasks approachable, explainable, and repeatable.
    In this presentation we will take you on our journey from simple beginnings (naively thinking storing notebooks on Github was good enough) to our current CI/CD pipeline with JupyterHub and beyond!
    We'll demo a few notebooks we've built that are used daily for various tasks including triaging hunting results, evaluating detection settings, and gathering metrics on the state of our security operations.
