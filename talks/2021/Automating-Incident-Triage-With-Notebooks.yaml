  Incident triage is a fundamental part of SOC work, and ensuring efficient and accurate triage results can be the key to catching and responding to major security incidents.
  Despite its criticality triage is often a very manual task with little quality control.
  In this presentation we will talk about how Notebooks, and automated execution of them can be used to help create a software defined triage process that helps analysts by providing additional context, saves them time be pre-producing data, and validates their work to ensure quality, reputability, and auditability.
