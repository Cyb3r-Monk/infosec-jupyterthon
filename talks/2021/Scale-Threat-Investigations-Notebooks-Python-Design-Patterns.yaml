      Mark has been helping network defenders fight the good fight for much of his nearly two-decade professional career, initially with a top DNS & Whois threat intel provider, then at RiskIQ, a leader in attack surface management and threat actor infrastructure mapping, and most recently at Microsoft. He is always coding, even when that's not really his job, and he's passionate about placing powerful technology in the hands of mere mortals, especially when it enables them to thwart malicious use of the Internet and abuse of trust.
      Mark lives in a condo with an over-engineered, Python-enabled, mostly-functional home automation setup somewhere in the greater Seattle area.

  Writing code to scale threat hunting and incident response has been a proven practice of sophisticated infosec teams for years; now, with notebooks and well-designed Python libraries, orgs of all sizes, budgets and maturity levels can deploy repeatable IR tactics, find evil faster, and quickly level-up their entire team.
  In this session, we'll underscore why notebooks matter, learn to add context and perform automated triage of IOCs, create our own threat intel for hunting activities, and connect different libraries, products and intel sources in a single repeatable pipeline.
  Along the way, we'll explore a few low-level Python design patterns that will make your libraries super easy to use in a notebook context, even for folks early in their programming journey.
