  Notebooks are a powerful tool — we all love simplifying the gap between research, presentation, and delivery of results, right?
  However, the best way to use notebooks is often different depending on the end consumer of the information you’re providing.
  For example, notebooks can be a place to quickly iterate on research and create a proof of concept, or they can enable data consumption and analysis for a non-technical user group.
  Using notebooks effectively can have a positive impact on your business. But how do different groups achieve that impact?
  During this talk, I’ll take you through some examples of how we’ve used notebooks to support different business needs at Expel.
  We’ll talk about the problems we solved, the tools we used to do it, and how notebooks helped us make the results understandable — and most importantly, accessible — to our teams, including non-technical users.
