  I will show walk users through connecting to an Elastic cluster, running queries that will give them an idea of what their audit policy looks like based on the EventID's. I will also walk them through matching the events they have to possible rules that would fire in the Elastic SIEM.
  When you have logs, but don't know what's in them...I'll show users how to enumerate the logs and understand the fields/values that are important.
