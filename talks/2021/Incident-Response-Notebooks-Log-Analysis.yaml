  Log analysis is a big problem in incident response.  It is common for an incident to have to analyze gigabytes of events, usually in unhelpful formats.
  During the presentation, a proposal for the parsing, filtering and analysis of these events will be shown.  In the same way, it will talk about the limitations of pandas for the analysis of large amounts of data and how these situations can be handled.
  This presentation is directly applicable to incident response but the techniques described can be used in any field of data analysis.
