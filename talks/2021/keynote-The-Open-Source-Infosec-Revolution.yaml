  "If you want to go fast, go alone, if you want to go far, go together"
  The sharing of knowledge, techniques and tools through open collaboration is key to cyber defense.
  Initiatives like SIGMA, MITRE ATT&CK, Jupyter and OTRF allow defenders to pool resources to combat increasingly sophisticated and coordinated adversaries.
  Integrating open source tools like Jupyter into your SOC processes is not without cost: there is a learning curve that can appear steep.
  Is it worth the investment? Where do I start? What is the payback?
  John will describe his journey with Jupyter notebooks in Infosec to try to answer these questions.
