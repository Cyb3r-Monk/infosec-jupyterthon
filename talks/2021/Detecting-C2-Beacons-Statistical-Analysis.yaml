  RITA is an open source framework developed by Active Countermeasures. It can perform beaconing detection, DNS tunneling detection and blacklist checking.
  In this session, we will partially implement the RITA beacon analyzer in jupyter notebook and analyze a dataset that was generated and shared with the community by Ali Aswahali(@ali_alwashali). The dataset comprises of  around 2M records created from all "malware-traffic-analysis.net" PCAP files, from 2013 to 2021.
  The audience will be able to use the notebook, replicate the analysis, and , hopefully, use it in their environments.
