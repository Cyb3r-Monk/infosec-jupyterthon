    When Troy was 5 years old he used to open executable files in notepad and edit them.
    He thought he was programming. Now he opens them in IDA pro and thinks he's reverse engineering.
    His knack for pattern recognition and apparent fear of allowing puzzles to defeat him has led him to his passion of CyberSecurity.
    He has spent his career in SOCs as multiple Tiers of Analyst and an Investigator; working ticket queues, hunting for security incidents, rapidly prototyping new ideas into existence, working terrible hours and questioning career decisions.
    At Awake Security he is a Threat Researcher who uses his skills and knowledge to ensure that Awake empowers the analyst as much as possible.
    He loves what he does, and hopes what he does ensures that others do too.

    There has been some attention given lately to different protocols used to encrypt DNS traffic and their pros and cons with respect to privacy and security.
    Since encrypted DNS on our networks could lessen the visibility of several of tools in our security stacks, I looked into ways to detect and prevent its use in an enterprise network setting.
    One of the simplest options is to collect and use domains and IPs publicly known to be used for DNS encryption.
    There is a good source for that information, but unfortunately the format is not ideal.
    This notebook will take you through the process of decoding DNSStamps into IOCs that can be used to detect and/or block the use of DNS encryption on your network.
    This code can be used to ensure that the lists are always up to date based on the configuration files that DNS Encryption software uses.
