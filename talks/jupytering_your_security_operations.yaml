    This talk will no focus on a particular notebook.
    The talk focus on our approach in solving some of the security operations such as:
    - Low efficiency such as number of ‘clicks’ before the analyst can obtain the information they need for an event
    - High turnover which leads to operation centers not running in a consistent standard
    - Lack of knowledge sharing between analysts
    - Lack of adequate documentation of work
    - Different technology user interfaces to work with
    We will share our approach to the problem using a combination of containerized solution (Kubernetes), Jupyter notebook and API wrappers. With that, we built an environment that attempts to solve some of these problems.
    The jupyter environment allows an analyst to perform different external and internal queries such as virustotal, passivetotal or internal tooling such as ticketing system, SIEM and sandbox solution through the use of different API wrappers. The analyst could stay in the same environment to perform their investigation without pivoting to different platforms. And since Jupyter Notebook supports python, an analyst could use python to work with the data and also leverage different data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, and hvplot to assist them to investigate or hunt. The analyst could also share their investigation thought process by sharing their notebooks with other analysts without much additional documentation work.
    The environment is managed using containerized technology. This provides the advantage of providing a consistent environment that the analyst does not need to maintain themselves. It also allows us to patch or upgrade the environment efficiently. We also included personal and shared persistent storage that allows the analyst to store their own notebooks and also allow sharing of notebooks with other analysts easily.
