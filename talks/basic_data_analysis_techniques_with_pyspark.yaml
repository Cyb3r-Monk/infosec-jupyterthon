    In this session, we will go over a few data analysis techniques leveraging PySpark and visualizations to generate additional context around security event logs and get a better understanding of adversarial techniques through data.
    We are going to be using the open dataset created by the Mordor project's team after following the Mitre ATT&CK evaluations methodology and executing the public emulation plans.
